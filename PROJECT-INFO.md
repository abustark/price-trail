# PriceTrail — Project Info Sheet (source of truth for resume & portfolio summaries)

> **Purpose:** every fact an AI (or a person) needs to write a resume "Projects"
> entry or a portfolio project summary for PriceTrail — without reading the code.
> Generate prose from these facts only; do not invent beyond them. Tune length
> and tone to the target (resume = dense & quantified; portfolio = readable &
> story-driven).

**One-liners (pick by context):**
- *10 words:* Ecommerce price tracker with Google sign-in, history charts, cron rescans.
- *25 words:* PriceTrail is a Next.js + MongoDB price tracker for Amazon India, Flipkart, Myntra and AJIO with Google sign-in, guest watchlists, daily cron scans and SVG history charts.
- *Elevator pitch:* PriceTrail tracks ecommerce prices before you buy. Paste any product URL to record snapshots over time, see highest/lowest/typical prices with change frequency, get a BUY/WAIT verdict with deal score, set target-price alerts, and let daily cron rescans keep history fresh. Guests keep a private browser watchlist that migrates to their Google account on sign-in.

## 3. Architecture (how it fits together)

- **App Router + Auth.js + raw Mongo driver:** server components (`page.tsx`, `products/[id]/page.tsx`, `ProductList`, `BuyAdviceCard`) read Mongo directly via `lib/db.ts` (global client caching, 5 indexes); client components (`TrackForm`, `PriceChart`, `TargetPriceAlert`, `RescanButton`, `GoogleSignInPill`) call 7 API paths.
- **Two auth paths, one session cookie:** standard `[...nextauth]` handler plus a fast popup flow — `GoogleSignInPill` opens Google OAuth (520×620), `/auth/google/callback` posts the code to `POST /api/auth/google`, which exchanges + verifies and sets the same `authjs.session-token` JWT cookie, then reloads.
- **Guest-first with claim:** signed-out visitors get an httpOnly `pricetrail-guest-id` UUID cookie (180d) via `getOrCreateViewer`; lists are guest-scoped with a sync banner. On sign-in `claimGuestProducts` moves guest products to the Google `userId`, merging duplicates by `normalizedUrl` and re-pointing samples; home shows `Saved N products…` notice.
- **Scanner isolated:** `lib/scanner.ts` (538 lines) does direct fetch (Chrome/125 UA, 18s timeout, 3 attempts) then optional `SCRAPER_PROXY_*` render fallback; parse order JSON-LD → OG price meta → store-specific regex (Flipkart/Amazon/Myntra/AJIO selectors) → generic `data-price/data-testid/commerce JSON`; MRP variants, currency normalisation (`₹→INR`), stock detection, blocked-page (<50KB + captcha/robot) and SSRF guards. Replaceable without touching UI/analytics.
- **Cron scans due products:** `GET /api/cron/scan` (requires `CRON_SECRET` via query/header/Bearer) scans ≤20 due (`active && nextScanAt<=now`, `scanEveryHours` default 6) via `scanDueProducts`, updating `nextScanAt` and `lastError` on failure.
- **Instant-chart backfill:** first scan queues a FIFO backfill (1.5s) inserting a 6-point `mrp-baseline/historical` synthesis (90/65/45/30/14/3d) so charts render before real history accumulates.

## 4. Feature inventory (technical depth for bullet generation)

1. **Paste-to-track** — `POST /api/products {url}` resolves short-links (`amzn.in/amzn.to/a.co`, `fkrt.it/dl.*`, `ajiio.in`), follows ≤5 redirects, normalises (strips tracking params, canonicalises), asserts allowed host, then upserts by `{userId,normalizedUrl}`.
2. **4 dedicated + 1 generic adapters** — Amazon India, Flipkart, Myntra, AJIO regex paths plus schema.org/OG/generic fallback for the wider web; URL normalisation preserves `affid/asin/pid/sku/tag`.
3. **Price stats** — highest+date, lowest+date, most-common + %, change count, avg change frequency, current/stock/source; `calculatePriceStats` in `lib/analytics.ts`.
4. **Buy advice** — verdict `BUY NOW / FAIR PRICE / WAIT` with deal score /100, SVG gauge, headline + reason, trend (📉/📈/⚖️) + percentile + savings chips; thresholds ≥75 buy, ≥48 fair; single-sample `Gathering Baseline` state.
5. **Interactive SVG chart** — 720×300, downsampled to 220 (preserves first/last/min/max), MRP dashed line, live vs historical dots, crosshair + keyboard (arrows/Home/End/Escape) inspection, ARIA summary, legend + snapshot count.
6. **Target-price alerts (in-app)** — `PATCH /api/products/:id`, number input + −5%/−10%/−15%/Lowest presets, progress bar, `🎯 Target Price Reached!` state + list badges; no email/push worker.
7. **Manual rescan + reset** — `POST .../scan` with spinner, `DELETE .../samples` (confirm → clear + rescan + refresh).
8. **Guest-to-account migration** — private browser watchlist, duplicate-merge claim, concise confirmation; failures never surface as empty lists.
9. **Recent-drops tape** — `GET /api/recent-drops` (6h cookie rotation, 14-URL Sep-2026 pool, ≤5 scans @8s, returns 3) with skeleton → `▼ %/₹` chips.
10. **Google sign-in UX** — `G Sign in` pill, popup + blocked-popup redirect fallback, `details` account menu (avatar/name/email + server-action sign-out), `Sign-in setup` disabled state when creds missing.
11. **Dark/light theme** — `data-theme` + `localStorage pricetrail-theme`, FOUC-prevent inline script, `role=switch` toggle, per-scheme `themeColor`.
12. **Content + legal** — `/how-it-works`, `/privacy`, `/terms`, iPhone-style `BackButton`, `SiteFooter` (Stores + Legal + `abufolio.vercel.app` credit), `not-found` + per-product `loading` skeletons.
13. **Scraper-proxy support** — `SCRAPER_PROXY_ENDPOINT/TOKEN/URL_PARAM/TOKEN_PARAM/AUTH_HEADER` (query- or header-token styles) for legal render providers.
14. **Security** — per-user `{userId,normalizedUrl}` uniqueness, `viewer.userId`-scoped detail queries (`notFound` on cross-user), `CRON_SECRET` gate, `sanitizeErrorMessage` (masks secrets, preserves bot/proxy/captcha hints, 200-char cap).

## 5. Quality & testing

- **No unit/e2e framework:** no jest/vitest/cypress/playwright dependencies in `package.json`.
- **Gates that do exist:** `npm run lint` (ESLint `next/core-web-vitals`), `npm run typecheck` (`tsc --noEmit`, strict, ES2017, `@/*` alias), `npm run build` (`next build`).
- **Manual QA traces:** 3 `.playwright-cli/*.yml` dumps (2026-09-12), `PASTE- sandbox browser/` visual kit, 6 `artifacts/*.png` (light/dark desktop + mobile + chart viewport).
- **Docs in-repo:** `README.md` (177 lines), `AUDIT.md`, `ANTIGRAVITY_EXECUTION_PROMPT.md` (Arena execution spec), `AGENTS.md`, this sheet.

---

## 6. Scale metrics (quantifiables)

- **76** git-tracked files; **4,799 lines** across TS/TSX/CSS (largest `globals.css` 663, `scanner.ts` 538, `PriceChart.tsx` 377).
- **7 API paths / 8 route files / 10 method handlers** (GET×4, POST×3, PATCH×1, DELETE×2).
- **15 components** (server + client split), **9 lib modules**, **7 pages** (`/`, `/products/[id]`, `/how-it-works`, `/privacy`, `/terms`, `/auth/google/callback` + loading/not-found/OG-image).
- **2 collections, 5 indexes** (`{userId,normalizedUrl}` unique, `{active,nextScanAt}`, `{userId,updatedAt}`, `price_samples {productId,capturedAt}` + `{productId,price}`).
- **4 dedicated stores + 1 generic**; **14-URL** recent-drops pool; **3 demo chips** (iPhone 16, WH-1000XM5, Pegasus).
- **6 price samples** synthesised per new product for instant charts; up to **1,000 samples** loaded per detail page, last **12** shown.
- **58 commits** on `main`.

## 7. Engineering practices worth mentioning

- Scanner/UI/analytics separation — `lib/scanner.ts` replaceable without touching watchlist or stats.
- Per-user isolation — unique compound index + scoped queries, fail-closed `notFound` on cross-user access.
- Secret hygiene — `CRON_SECRET` gate with non-prod bypass only when unset; error sanitiser masks DB/auth secrets.
- SSRF + redirect safety — private-host blocklist, ≤5-hop safe-redirect enforcement, URL canonicalisation.
- Degradation by design — proxy fallback, blocked-page detection, backfill synthesis, `Sign-in setup` state instead of broken avatar.
- Single-query discipline — detail loads product + 1,000 samples in two scoped reads; dashboard lists 50 with ISO-serialised dates.
- Keyboard + ARIA chart — pointer + keyboard inspection, live regions, labelled controls, 44px targets.
- Trunk-based Git workflow; AI-assisted development governed by in-repo agent rules (`AGENTS.md`).

## 9. Ready-made examples (regenerate freely — facts only)

**Resume bullets:**
- Built an ecommerce price tracker (Next.js 15 App Router, React 19, TypeScript, MongoDB driver) for Amazon India, Flipkart, Myntra and AJIO plus a generic JSON-LD/OG fallback, with short-link resolution and SSRF-safe normalisation.
- Designed a scraper→upsert pipeline (Chrome UA, 18s×3 attempts, proxy fallback, store-specific + generic parsing, MRP/currency/stock extraction) with per-user `{userId,normalizedUrl}` uniqueness and daily Vercel Cron rescans (≤20 due per run).
- Implemented Google OAuth via Auth.js (standard handler + fast popup code-exchange flow) with guest UUID watchlists that merge into accounts on sign-in, plus in-app target-price alerts and manual rescan/history-reset actions.
- Created a hand-rolled SVG price chart (220-point downsampling, MRP overlay, crosshair + keyboard inspection) with highest/lowest/mode/change-frequency stats and a BUY/FAIR/WAIT verdict with deal score.
- Shipped a themed responsive app (custom CSS, dark/light with FOUC guard, 7 pages, SEO/OG images) on Vercel; gated by ESLint + `tsc --noEmit` + `next build`, no unit framework.

**Resume project paragraph (3 lines):** Ecommerce price tracker built with Next.js 15, React 19 and MongoDB, deployed on Vercel with daily cron rescans. Features dedicated Amazon/Flipkart/Myntra/AJIO adapters plus generic fallback, Google sign-in with guest-to-account watchlist migration, and an interactive SVG history chart with buy advice and target alerts. Ships as a themed responsive app with 7 API paths, per-user isolation and strict TypeScript + ESLint gates.

**Portfolio card (title + ~30 words + stack):** PriceTrail — paste any product link to track its price over time, see highs/lows/trends with a buy verdict, set target alerts, and let daily scans keep history fresh. Guest mode included. `Next.js · React · MongoDB · Auth.js · Vercel`

**Tone/length guide for the AI:** resume = 3–5 dense bullets or one 3-line paragraph, lead with verbs and numbers, keywords from §8; portfolio = friendly paragraph + feature list + stack chips, mention the 4-store adapters, the guest-claim flow, and the hand-rolled chart; never claim email alerts, PWA installability, or a unit test suite — none exist.
